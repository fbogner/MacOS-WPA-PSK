    About:
    grab-MacOS-WPA-PSK is a tool to retrieve and decode the current wireless network key.
    It is just a proof-of-concept to remind users that Apple treats this value as non-secret.
    You might have expected it to require root to obtain, and be protected in the Keychain. Nope.

    Why not recover the passphrase?:
    First, because it is unimportant, and not actually used to join a network.
    Second, you cannot efficiently work backwards to the wifi passphrase from the PSK.
    The PSK is generated from the passphrase using PBKDF2 with 4096 rounds of HMAC-SHA1 using the
    SSID as a nonce, making brute-force guessing expensive-ish, and most people use long-ish
    passphrases so it won't even be a matter of guessing all 10 or 12 character sequences, which
    itself would be too many.

    Usage:
        python grab-MacOS-WPA-PSK.py

    Alternately:
        chmod +x ./grab-MacOS-WPA-PSK.py
        ./grab-MacOS-WPA-PSK.py

    Changelog:
    1.0:    initial release. None of this 0.x crap. It works, so it's 1.0.
    1.01:   fix from michaelrice, to correctly parse the fields when there are SSIDs with spaces
    1.02:	"Ported" to Python 2
